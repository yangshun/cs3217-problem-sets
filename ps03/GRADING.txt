Welldone! But you submitted late..

Problem 5:

Testing is not done quite right. You kind of misunderstood what's glassbox testing.
Here is an example of how to write test cases:
Blackbox testing:

Test background loads ok and is scrollable
	Still scrollable with game objects. 
Test implementation of buttons
	Save, load
		Save/load empty screen
		Save/load one object (try different types)
		Save/load one object of each type
		Save/load with many objects
		Load with empty screen
		Load with screen full of objects.
		Load non-existent file
	Reset
		Clear empty screen
		Clear screen with one object
		Clear screen with one object of each type
		Clear screen with many objects
Test implementation of game objects (wolf, pig, obstacle):
	Drag in palette
		to game area
		When gamearea is scrolled
		When gamearea is not scrolled
		to palette or button area 
	Drag in gamearea
		to game area
		to palette
	Rotate and resize in palette (nothing happens)
		Rotate and resize in gamearea
		Drag, Rotate, Resize then Move
		Drag, Resize, Rotate then Move
	Double tap in palette
		After rotating and resizing in gamearea
		Without rotating and resizing in gamearea
	Double tap in gamearea
	Single tap for obstacle in gamearea
Test Compliance with Game Rules
	Check that not more than one pig or wolf can be created
	Check that multiple obstacles can be created

Glass box testing (depends on the actual code)

GameObject (gestures cannot be tested)
	initwithImage:andFrame:andPalette:andScrollView:andObjectType:andController:andOriginalSize
	init and test by calling count on array
GameViewController
	addObjectsToGame
		add objects to the array using this method and test using count (count number of elements in the array)
		add when array is empty
		add when array is non-empty
	removeObjectsFromGame
		remove objects from the array and test using count (count number of elements in the array)
		remove when the array is empty
		remove when the array is non-empty
	createNewBlock
		call the method and test using count (count number of elements in the array)
GameViewControllerExtension
	Save, load, restart
	When all objects are in the palette
	When all objects are in the gamearea
	When some objects are in the palette, and others in the gamearea
	When more of GameBlocks are created in the gamearea
GameWolf
	initWolfWithPalette:andScrollView:andController
	when no wolves are created
	when 1 wolf is created already
GamePig
	initPigWithPalette:andScrollView:andController
	when no pigs are created
	when 1 pig is created already
GameBlock
	Set GameBlock enum to different values to test if images are appearing correctly

Comments by Prof:

* Sorry you had to suffer, but this is the nature of my classes. The point here is to simulate real life learning 
as closely as possible. We give you some guidance, but not a whole lot basically to give you space to learn. Your
situation is a little unfortunate because you lack the experience that the other students have from previous classes.
Not to worry lah. You survive the next 2 problem sets, you will have levelled up sufficiently so that your one
year in ME will not leave you behind the better SoC students. Endure lah. What doesn't kill you will make you strong.
The learning that you do in the midst of the suffering will stay with you. You die die also won't forget. :-)

* You are actually doing well, notwithstanding the teething issues and delay. Should be better in PSs 4 and 5.
