Can be improved:
- Should have disabled device rotation  // -2pts
- Level design: when editting level name, after I click load, the keyboard should be dismissed  // -2pts
- Position of the arrows can be better (the arrow should be at the mouth of the wolf
- Count of wolf's lives are not correct? I still can play 1 more turn even when     // -2pts
there is no lives left.
- Game performance can be improved. It's probably due to you using your own engine.
- When scroll gamearea, the game should still play.

Something nice to have:
- Only one pigs? And the health of the pig is handled in PlayViewController?
- Other kind of blocks, except for straw one will never be destroyed?
- How will you support multiple kind of breaths?
- After saving a level, the level should appear in Play mode as well. I don't
want to have to go to level design and select level.
Instead you could have had the health of each objects handled in the GameObjects.
Objects lose health upon collisions.

I think you put too much logic on PlayViewController. When you add more features
you definitely need to have them handled by different kind of objects, otherwise
PlayViewController will be very complicated.

You traded the complexity of the games (while still barely fulfil requirements)
with the better UI. If you added a few things I mentioned above, the game would
be more complicated and require changes in code design.

However, it is fine if you're aware of the trade-off you're making here.

Truth to be told, your submission is very welldone.
Very nice UI & animation =) You even had sound! I like it.
