Question 2(h)
========

Alternative representation:
 - Store the coordinates of two opposite corners of the rectangle.
 Advantages: The other two corner values can be easily calculated.
 Disadvantages: Can be a hassle to calculate the center point, width and height.


// TA: WRONG!! 2 corners are not enough to determine the rotation and two other
// corners of the rectangle. Remember the rectangle can be rotated, not necessary
// have edges parallel to the axes.



Question 2(i): Reflection (Bonus Question)
==========================
(a) How many hours did you spend on each problem of this problem set?

 I spent a few hours to read up on the basics of Objective-C to get a good grasp of the fundamentals. The smaller parts took
 me lesser time, around half an hour to fully understand what each part required and how different parts of the program linked
 with each other. 
 
 The major part of this code was the method overlapsWithRect. I spent a few hours solely on this part itself. I had to google
 about algorithms on overlapping of rotated rectangles and had to digest them. This itself took up bulk of the time as I had
 to understand it and come up with an implementation for it.

(b) In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this problem set?

 I think I could have looked up more examples of Objective-C code and learnt how they were written so that I wouldn't have a
 problem with the syntax and the usage of the methods and properties.

(c) What could the CS3217 teaching staff have done better to improve your learning experience in this problem set?

 It could have been made clear that the positive y-axis points southwards to reduce ambiguity.
 They could have gave a rough outline of the approach to the question.
 This problem feels like a mathematics problem rather than a programming one. The toughest part 
 was coming up with the algorithm to check for the overlapping.

// TA: Thanks! But just curious, from which source did you know that the
// positive y-axis points southwards? Some students missed it.
