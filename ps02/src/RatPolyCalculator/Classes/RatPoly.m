 Question 1(a)
 ========
 
 Notice that r = p - q is actually r = p + (-q):
 
    foreach term, t_q in q:
      multiply by -1
 
    therefore -q is obtained
 
 then use polynomial addition algorithm to p and -q to obtain p + (-q)
 
 Question 1(b)
 ========
 
 r = p * q:
    set r = empty
    foreach term, t_p in p:
      set a new polynomial s = q
      foreach term, t_s in s:
        replace t_s with the product of t_s and t_p (by multiplying the coefficients and summing up the powers)
      add s to the existing r via polynomial addition
          
 Question 1(c)
 ========
 
 Let T(p,i) be [p getTerm:i]
 
 u = q * v + r:
 set q = empty and r = empty
 if degree(u) < degree(v)
   q = empty and r = v
// TA: q = 0
 else {
   while (degree(u) >= degree(v)) {
    set RatTerm qTerm to be the quotient of T(q,0) and T(v,0)
    set s = multiply v and qTerm using polynomial multiplication algorithm
    add s to existing q
    subtract s from existing u using polynomial subtraction algorithm
    set r = u
   }
 }
 
 Question 2(a)
 ========
 
 Self should not be null as we want a real object that exists. We want to know that an error has occurred if nil is encountered.
 Nothing will happen. A nil value will be returned.
 If NaN is passed to add and sub, the new_denom will be 0, hence the result will still be a Nan and there is no need to check if arg is a Nan.
 However if arg is a NaN in the div method, the initWithNum will take in 0 as an argument and the RatNum that is initialized will have a value of 0. Hence there is a need to check for NaN in the div method.
 
 Question 2(b)
 ========
 
 valueOf turns an existing NSString into a RatNum object, which logically need not be invoked from an instance.
 There is no need for an existing RatNum object to exist before creating a new RatNum object from an NSString, therefore it is a class method.
 An instance method can be used instead, in which the input parameter is an NSString and the instance's numer and denom is modified.
 
 Question 2(c)
 ========
 
 1. initWithNumer:Denom:
    - Less complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Simple assignment of numer and denom to x and y respectively.
 
 2. checkRep
    - Less complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Does not require gcd of numer and denom to be 1.
 
 3. stringValue
    - More complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Have to use gcd to get the fraction in the simplest form
 
 4. isEqual
    - More complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Have to convert both self and arg's numer and denom to simplest form
      before comparison
 
 Question 2(d)
 ========
 
 The numer and denom attributes are readonly, hence they cannot be changed after initialization and each RatNum instance is immutable. New RatNum objects are also created via initialization, which will go through the checkRep process. Hence putting checkRep at the end of initialization is sufficient.
 
 Question 3(a)
 ========
 
 I included calls to checkRep only in the default constructor. Because in all other methods, a new object with the relevant parameters will be created and returned. In other words, in all methods, the default constructor will be called and therefore checkRep will be called.
 
 Question 3(b)
 ========
 
 1. checkRep
    - Less complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Does not require expt to be 0 when coeff = ZERO
 
 2. initWithCoeff:Exp:
    - Less complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Don't have to assign expt as 0 if coeff = ZERO
 
 Question 3(c)
 ========
 
 1. checkRep
    - More complex in terms of clarity and execution efficiency.
    - Have to enforce the new requirement

  // TA: Need to change initWithCoeff to handle the case where coeff is NaN
  // but expt is not 0
 
 Question 3(d)
 ========
 
 I prefer to have both sets of representation invariants. Having stricter conditions will reduce the likelihood of errors in the program.

 Day 4 - RatPoly debugging
 Day 5 - Creating unit test cases + debugging
 
 In total I think I spent around 20 over hours. I worked on this problem set every single day and I find that debugging takes longer than the coding itself.

 // TA: good practice to work on it everyday!
 // Prof: Right. Debugging always takes up the most time, which is why you need to be thinking hard
 // about the problem and design before you start. More thinking. Less coding -- or debugging will kill you. 
 
 (b) In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you spent solving this problem set?
 
 While creating test cases, I copied the expression xˆ3-2*x+3 from ps02.pdf and the output was not what I expected. 
 So I typed x^3-2*x+3 manually and the output was right. I was extremely puzzled by this erratic behaviour of the code and went to check my algorithm many times, spending close to 3 hours on finding out the reason for the different behaviour of the seemingly identical input.
 
 Only after many rounds of debugging did I realise that the ˆ symbol that I copied from the pdf file was different from the ^ character that I checked for in my algorithm (notice that the copied symbol is smaller: ˆ vs ^). This is perhaps the most useful lesson learnt from this problem set, not to copy inputs from sources where the encoding may be different.
 
 I think I could have wrote out all the invariants on a piece of paper and made sure my code followed the invariants strictly rather than spending time debugging then finding out that one particular case failed because I did not realise that the invariant was in place.
 
 
 (c) What could the CS3217 teaching staff have done better to improve your learning experience in this problem set?
 
 This problem set is extremely well set. I'm glad that the ambiguity is reduced as compared to problem set 1. It was a good thing to provide us with the implementation of RatNum, which kickstart-ed us in doing RatTerm followed by RatPoly. From this problem set, I see for myself how code is built up from small classes to bigger ones which consist of many smaller classes.
 
 All in all, I enjoyed this problem set. It is challenging and very rewarding.
 // Prof: Good. :-)
