Problem Set 5

**************************************
Problem 1: What is YOUR game gonna be?
**************************************

MAIN SCREEN
===========

The game starts off with the main menu screen where the player can choose between two options:

a. Start Game
-------------
- User can choose from 3 pre-designed levels and play it

b. Design Level
---------------
- Takes the user to the level designer where the user can design their own level and play it subsequently

THE GAME EXPLAINED
==================

a. Playing View
---------------
The playing view is divided into 3 parts:

1. Scoreboard
- Displays the number of breathe that the wolf has left. Note that it is the amount of lives left, hence the wolf can effectively shoot 6 breathes.

2. Game Area
- Has the wolf, the pig, the arrow and shooting guide

3. Power board
- Has a purple bar indicating the power of the breathe
- A fire button at the bottom right-hand corner.

b. How to play
--------------
The wolf starts with 6 breathes. Each breathe shot will remove a heart.
User adjusts the direction of the shot by touching the arrow and shifting it.
To adjust the power, the user can touch the end of the power bar and translate it horizontally.
To fire the breathe, simply press fire.

c. Objective
------------
The objective of the game is to kill the pig. There are two ways of doing so:
1. Make the pig hit the ground above a certain velocity.
2. The breathe touches the pig directly.

The breathe interacts with the objects in the following manner:
1. Pig: Kills the pig. Itself is destroyed.
2. Straw block: Destroys straw block and velocity is reduced. Itself is destroyed.
3. Other blocks: Itself is destroyed.
4. Ground: Itself is destroyed.

If the breathe gets shot out of the screen, it will be automatically destroyed after 8.0 seconds.

The fire button can only be pressed when the current breathe is destroyed. This is to ensure that only one breathe can be present at any one time.

The game ends when:
1. Wolf runs out of breathe
- Game Over screen displayed. User can return to the previous screen.

2. Pig dies
- Victory screen displayed. User can return to the previous screen.

********************************
Problem 2: Implementing the Puff
********************************

a. 
User adjusts the direction of the shot by touching the arrow and shifting it.
To adjust the power, the user can touch the end of the power bar and translate it horizontally.
To fire the breathe, simply press fire button.
The length of the power bar indicates the starting velocity of the breathe projectile when it is added into the physics engine. I used this method is straightforward and easy to implement.

b.
I implemented a new subclass of PhysicsShape called PhysicsCircle. Next, I referred to a book on Game Physics Engines to write the algorithm for circle-rectangle interaction. 

Also, I modified the loop in the Physics Engine which checks for overlapping. If one of the objects is a circle, the circle-rectangle overlapping algorithm will be used instead of the usual rectangle-rectangle algorithm.

c. 
Interaction 1: Pig and Breathe
Pig will be killed and breathe will be destroyed. 

Interaction 2: Breathe and Straw block
Breathe velocity reduced and straw block destroyed.

Interaction 3: Breathe and other blocks
Breathe destroyed and impulse applied on block.

Interaction 4: Block and Pig
Pig displays "Ouch" message.

Interaction 4: Breathe and ground
Breathe destroyed.

The physics engine should not take care of the object-object interaction as it only updates the position of the physics object model.

Since the logic is in the Play view controller, the object-object interactions should be handled in there. The physics engine posts a notification when there is collision between two objects, the game view controller will receive the two objects and determine the kind of interaction. Next, it will respond with the necessary actions and modify the view accordingly.

I used this strategy as it is not messy because the logic for ALL object-object interactions are handled by one single method. The method then decides the type of interactions that occurred. The decisions made are hidden from the physics engine. 

d. 
I chose NSTimer as the Physics Engine that I used in PS4 also ran on NSTimer. The timer in the game and in the physics engine ran on the same time step, which makes integration easy. 

The advantage of timers is that it is easy to use and less confusing. However, it does not allow the concurrent execution of code. It blocks the execution of the rest of the application. 

Using multiple NSThread objects allows the main thread of the application to run. Threads can also be used to divide a large job into several smaller jobs, which can lead to performance increases on multi-core computers.

Central dispatch is useful but time is needed to learn it, and time is something I'm running out of.

Problem 5: Final Reflection
***************************

a. The whole recess week was spent on this problem set. I spent 2 days figuring out the Physics Engine for circle-rectangle collision. I was done with the requirements by Wednesday, but I spent the rest of the days designing the game art and improving
  the playing experience.

b. I should have used an open-source physics engine. Its performance is way better than my self-written one. Too late to change though =/

c. Nothing much, this problem set was the mosy enjoyable by far, as I was able to reaps the fruits of my labour. Although I spent alot of time designing the art and making it feel like a complete iOS game, I enjoyed the process and I treated it as training for the final project (:

d. Yes they have helped tremendously. When a person spends almost everyday on something, he/she is bound to learn something right? This was a sadistically satisfying 6-week. I feel confident about learning new stuff independently and making my own app now. (:
